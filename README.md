# Welcome to YardToTable

This site was created to simplify recipe searching while keeping the high level of functionality users would expect. Search by recipe, ingredient, cook time, rating, course, and cuisine.  Use as many of these attributes as you would like!

YardToTable uses both the Google Maps API and the Yummly API to generate data in accordance with search terms. Once a search is performed you may view the recipie, ingredients, generate a grocery list and view the closest grocery store to you.

This is a fully responsive web application and can be viewed on your mobile device, tablet, or computer.
