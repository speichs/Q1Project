# Q1Project
#**Yard To Table**

>Who will this project target?
> Users interested in gardening and cooking their own food.

>What problem will this solve?
>Though there are recipe sites scattered across the internet, the interfaces are often lacking simplicity. Further, the forced level of user specificity in search parameters often means that todays user, with their lack of attention-span fails to complete the process.  This site will also provide the user with the ability to create a grocery list for their chosen dish and find a grocery store local to them for the additional ingredients they need but do not grow.  

>Inputs?
> The user will be asked to provide any of the following input: ingredients, recipie name, time of cooking, recipe rating, if it exists.  

> Outputs
> recipe, ingredient list, cook time, grocery list, google map for choice of grocery store, directions to said store should you want them.


>APIs
>Yummly, GoogleMaps(Places, Geolocation, directions), twilio,  

>Technologies employed
>HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JQuery, Aforementioned APIs


>MVP Goal: fully functional search for recipes that loads cards of recipes with pictures and ingredients and link to generate iframe of yummly recipe
